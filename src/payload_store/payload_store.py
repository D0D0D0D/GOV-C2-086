# PART: payload-store v0.4.0 (parts@1565fd9)
"""Short-lived scoped payload storage for keeping raw bodies out of graph state.

Scope contract (v0.3.0): the store is constructed with the template's own KB
partition key names via ``scope_keys`` (e.g. ``("production_company_id",
"project_id")``). Every ``put`` / ``resolve`` / ``delete`` call must supply a
``scope`` mapping containing exactly those keys with clean non-empty string
values, plus a ``session_id``. Anything else fails closed.

Reference format (v0.4.0): references are letter-only strings, never ``uuid4``
text -- see ``mint_reference``.

    The obvious choice, ``str(uuid4())``, is unsafe *as a reference* in this
    framework: its digit-and-hyphen shape collides with the ``detect_pii``
    ``phone_jp`` / ``credit_card`` / ``my_number_jp`` patterns for ~0.55% of
    generated values.  Because the S-2 input gate (``FunctionNode``'s ``@final``
    ``_security_gate_input``) *masks* what it matches, a colliding reference is
    silently rewritten to ``d1b78867-[MASKED]-0b14aba6e3cf`` inside the canonical
    envelope, and every later :meth:`PayloadStore.resolve` then fails closed with
    ``payload_ref_unknown``.  That surfaced as an unreproducible ~0.55%/envelope
    error rate in production and as intermittent CI failures.

    Encoding 16 CSPRNG bytes one nibble per letter makes the reference
    *lexically disjoint* from the digit-based PII patterns: with no digit
    present, no digit-run rule can match.  (Inside a JSON envelope the quoting
    also keeps it clear of the ``email`` / ``name`` patterns; the guarantee this
    format gives on its own is against the digit-based rules.)  This is a
    property of the reference format, not a workaround layered on the scanner --
    the scanner keeps full strength on real content.

    ``token_bytes`` rather than ``uuid4`` deliberately: uuid4 spends 6 of its
    128 bits on version/variant markers, which would both lower the entropy to
    122 bits and stamp every reference with a constant letter at two fixed
    positions.  Here all 128 bits are random.
